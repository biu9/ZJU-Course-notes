##### definition

​	given a function f defined on [a,b] and a set of nodes $a = x_0<x_1<...x_n=b$， a 

cubic spline interpolant S for f is a function that satisfies the following conditions:

- S(x) is a cubic polynomial, denoted $S_j(x)$, on the subinterval $[x_j,x_{j+1}]$, for each j=0,1...n-1
- $S_j(x_j)=f(x_j)$ and $S_j(x_{j+1}) = f(x_{j+1})$ for each j=0,1,2...n-1
- $S_{j+1}(x_{j+1})=S_j(x_{j+1})$ for each j=0,1...n-2
- $S'_{j+1}(x_{j+1})=S'_j(x_{j+1})$ for each j=0,1...n-2
- $S''_{j+1}(x_{j+1})=S''_j(x_{j+1})$ for each j=0,1,2...n-2
- one of the following sets of boundary conditions is satisfied:
   - $S''(x_0)=S''(x_n)=0$ (natural/free boundary)
  	- $S'(x_0) = f'(x_0) ~and~S'(x_n)=f'(x_n)$ (clamped boundary)
